# Custom Mapping Applications

This is the 3rd course of a 5 course specialization  in 'Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond' Course
taken on Coursera which is taught by UC San Diego. After completing the first 2 courses and having a great experience with them,
I had to continue and take the 3rd course. In this course I'll extensively work on Graphs and develop a small prototype of Google Maps
with the same functionality of searching for places and navigation. I'll be writing mostly backend code and I'd like to thank UCSD and 
their for providing me a great User Interface so that I only have to worry about the logic and implementation and not the look and 
feel of it.

Project learning outcomes
1.Design classes to implement a graph in Java
2.Implement basic graph search algorithms including breadth first search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Search.
3.Work with real-world geographic road data
4.Review your peers' software design
